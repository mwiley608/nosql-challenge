Bootcamp noSQL Challenge
This project was created as a homework assignment to set up and anlyze food hygiene rating data for establishments across the UK on behalf of a fictional food magazine. The main scripts are located in two Jupyter Notebook files. Part 1 of the setup to the project imports the data using MongoDB functions. Part 2 of the setup file adds a new restaurant to the dataset and updates several datatypes.

Part 3 of the project is contained in the analysis file. It reviews and answers several questions about the value rating and hygiene score of the different establishments.

References: The data for this project was gathered from the following online sources:
UK Food Standards Agency (https://www.food.gov.uk/) (2022). UK food hygiene rating data API. https://ratings.food.gov.uk/open-data/en-GB (https://ratings.food.gov.uk/open-data/en-GB) .

I used the two files contained in the Starter_Code folder as a starting point for my Jupyter Notebooks.
